# Bellabeat Case Study
*How can a wellness technology company play it smart?*

## Introduction
This capstone is part of the eighth and final course from the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**. In this project, I applied the five steps of the data analysis process taught in the program: **Ask**, **Prepare**, **Process**, **Analyze**, **Share**, and **Act**. Although Google’s certification program works with R, I chose Python to clean, analyze and visualize the data.

## Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused  products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.
